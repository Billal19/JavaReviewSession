(CNN)Republican Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin has tested positive for coronavirus after being exposed to someone with the virus earlier this week,
 according to his spokesman,
 making him the third GOP senator to test positive in 24 hours and threatening the quick confirmation prospects of Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court.
Sens. Mike Lee of Utah and Thom Tillis of North Carolina, who sit on the Judiciary Committee, tested positive for Covid-19 on Friday --
just days after attending a White House event where President Donald Trump nominated Barrett. Multiple attendees of that event, including Trump,
have tested positive in the week since the ceremony,
which featured many people not wearing masks and not observing social distancing protocols.
Johnson did not attend the Barrett nomination ceremony —
where several people appeared to have been exposed to the virus —
because he was quarantining from a prior exposure, during which he twice tested negative for the virus, according to the spokesman.
Unlike Democratic senators,
 Senate Republicans meet three times a week for lunch. And while they sit in a large room,
 they remove their masks to eat and to speak. Johnson, Lee and Tillis all attended Senate GOP lunches this week.
